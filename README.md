## System description

The UI is a single-page web application rendered as a template over a Flask API's root endpoint.

The user input query is sent over the exposed `/send` POST request and it's then handled by pattern matching using an AIML file wrapper.

The chatbot is capable of answering 4 main types of quetions:

1. What articles are of interest to me concerning X topic?
2. How many total articles are there in Code of law X?
3. What is article X of Code of law Y?
4. Define X for me

## Running the app

The flask chat app can be run like this:

```
python main.py
```
